🏝️ Treasure Island – Decision-Based Python Game
📌 Project Overview

Treasure Island is a beginner-friendly, text-based interactive game developed using Python.
The game guides the player through a sequence of choices, where each decision directly influences the final outcome.

The primary goal of this project is to practice decision-making logic, control flow, and user input handling, which are essential foundations for problem-solving and future AI-related development.

🎯 Why This Project?

I built this project to strengthen my understanding of how conditional logic and program flow work together in Python.
Rather than relying on external libraries or frameworks, this project focuses on core logic implementation, helping me develop a strong base before moving into advanced AI and Machine Learning concepts.

The structure of the game reflects decision-tree thinking, a concept that is widely used in rule-based systems and AI models.

🧠 Core Concepts Used

Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

User input handling using input()

Logical branching and decision trees

Sequential execution of programs

Writing clean and readable Python code
