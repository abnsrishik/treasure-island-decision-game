# 🏝️ Treasure Island – Decision-Based Python Game

## 📌 Project Overview

**Treasure Island** is a beginner-friendly, text-based interactive game built using **Python**.  
The player navigates through a series of choices, where each decision directly impacts the outcome of the game.

This project focuses on **decision-making logic, control flow, and user interaction**, which are foundational skills for problem-solving and future AI development.

## 🧠 Core Concepts Used

- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- User input handling
- Logical branching and decision trees
- Sequential program execution
- Clean and readable Python code

## ⚙️ How the Game Works

1. The player is introduced to a story-based scenario.
2. At each stage, the player must make a choice.
3. The program evaluates the choice using conditional logic.
4. Based on decisions, the player either progresses or reaches a game-ending condition.

This mimics **real-world decision systems**, where inputs determine outcomes.
